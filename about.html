      <h1> About our Company</h1>
      <p> The Mountain Bean Cafe, the coffee stop that you don't want to miss! Our goal is to have the best coffee while looking at the best views. This started as a small
      two man shop, now we are the stop that all mountain coffee lovers go to. We provide good quality coffee with affordable prices that everyone loves! This isn't just a 
      place for coffee and views, this is a place for community and people to talk and hangout.
        If coffee isn't your jam, then we have all sorts of food options, as well as teas, matcha options, and lemonade! Mountain Bean Cafe was founded by two best friends, 
      one who loves coffee, and one who loves creating different types of drinks... and both who love the beautiful Colorado mountains! With warm lighting and soft music inside, 
      and tables outside facing the mountains and a river, this is great place for everyone, come stop by!</p>
